      <h2>Rpad</h2>

      <p>Rpad is an interactive, web-based analysis program. Rpad pages
      are interactive workbook-type sheets based on R, an open-source
      implementation of the S language. Rpad is an analysis package, a
      page designer, and a gui designer all wrapped in one. Rpad
      makes it easy to develop powerful data analysis applications that
      can be shared with others (most likely on an intranet). The user
      doesn't have to install anything--everything's done through a
      browser.</p>

      <p>From the user's point of view, Rpad shouldn't really need any
      documentation. It just looks like a web page. The user can run a
      pre-canned analysis and poke around with the inputs and scripts
      and outputs. For designers of Rpad pages, some more background is
      helpful.</p>

  <p>Rpad is available in two versions: a local
  version and an intranet/internet version. The local version works
  through the user's local installation of R with through the user's web
  browser. The intranet/internet
  version works in client-server fashion with the user accessing a remote
  server through a standard web browser.</p>

      <h2>Editing and Running</h2>

      <p>The simplest way to set up a page is to use one or more Rpad
      script regions. Scripts can be inside of div, span, or textareas.
      Scripts can be R, shell, or javascript. Server-side shell scripts
      are useful for using other scripting or command-lines (python,
      octave, imagemagik, and so on). Javascript is useful for local
      processing, interactivity, or for debugging Rpad problems.</p>

      <p>To "run" or "calculate" a page, press the F9 key or use the
      mouse to press the "Calculate" menu option. While a web page is up, Rpad is
      communicating with the same R process. That means all the
      variables are still there (even if you change the script). This
      can have some desirable or undesirable effects, so it's good to
      be aware of it. Refreshing the page will restart the R process.</p>



      <p>In the default configuration, Rpad pages no longer have
      default in-page editing. As such, Rpad pages are normally
      created with an external text or HTML editor. In-browser editing is still too
      immature. There are two page-editing gui's that can be
      enabled:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><em>Basic editing gui --</em> The whole page is editable as a
        simple WYSIWYG html editor on browsers that support the
        contentEditable feature (Internet Explorer and Mozila with the
        Mozile plugin). This is much like the "lite"
        editor in Rpad 0.9.6. The page has a top bar with a menu and  </li>
        <li><em>Alternate editing gui --</em> The whole page is editable as a
        simple WYSIWYG html editor. This is much like the "lite"
        editor in Rpad 0.9.6. The page has a top bar with a menu and  </li>
      </ul>

      <p>These builtin page editors are somewhat limited. They may not
      generate very good HTML, and saving pages has some bugs in it
      (it doesn't save anything in the HEAD, and on some browsers,
      changes to INPUT blocks don't get saved right). For more
      advanced and reliable editing, use an external text or HTML
      editor. The builtin page editors are best used for online
      changes and exploration.
      </p>


      <h2>Rpad package</h2>

      <p>The Rpad package provides several R utility routines to help
      the user do graphs and generate HTML output and HTML GUI
      elements. </p>

      <h2>HTML File Structure</h2>

      <p>You can turn any HTML file into an editable Rpad page. Simply
      insert the following code into the page header:</p>
<pre>
&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="gui/Rpad.js">&lt;/script>
</pre>

<h3>Rpad sections</h3>

<p>Within the body of an HTML file, any element can be tagged
with 'dojoType="Rpad"'. Normally, this is a pre or textarea. Here's a
simple example:</p>

<pre>
&lt;pre dojoType="Rpad">
ls()
&lt;/pre>
</pre>

Rpad input blocks have several optional tags to control
behavior. Here's a more detailed example with options specifying that
the block runs only initially and the source is hidden:

<pre>
&lt;pre dojoType="Rpad" rpadRun="init" rpadHideSource="true">
ls()
&lt;/pre>
</pre>


<h4>rpadType</h4>
      <p>There are several kinds of Rpad input variations. The tag
      'rpadType' specifies the options, which include:</p>

<dl>
<dt><b>"R"</b> (the default)</dt><dd>R scripts of course</dd>  
<dt><b>"shell"</b></dt><dd>server shell script</dd>  
<dt><b>"javascript"</b></dt><dd>local javascript interpreter</dd>  
</dl>

<h4>rpadRun</h4>

<p>rpadRun controls when an Rpad section is calculated. Options are:

<dl>
<dt><b>"normal"</b> (the default)</dt><dd>R scripts of course</dd>  
<dt><b>"init"</b></dt><dd>The script will only run when the page
first loads and not after.</dd>  
<dt><b>"none"</b></dt><dd>The script will not run unless explicitly
directed by some event.</dd>  
<dt><b>"all"</b></dt><dd>The
block runs initially and every time the page is calculated.</dd>  
</dl>



<h4>rpadOutput</h4>

<p>rpadOutput controls how the output from Rpad section is
interpreted. Options are:

<dl>
<dt><b>"text"</b> (the default)</dt><dd>The results are
displayed as text.</dd>  
<dt><b>"html"</b></dt><dd>The results of the output are
displayed as html.</dd>  
<dt><b>"javascript"</b></dt><dd>Interpret the results as
javascript commands (with eval).</dd>  
<dt><b>"none"</b></dt><dd>Do nothing with the output.</dd>  
</dl>

<p>Within an R block with rpadOutput of "text" or "html", the
formatting can be switched between "text" and "html" by HTMLon() or
HTMLoff(). Rpad output sections are normally rendered as plain text
with a fixed-width font, so text script outputs are formatted
properly. The output blocks can also contain HTML codes for displaying
images or for formatted blocks. To change to HTML formatting, send
'&lt;htmlon/>' to the output. This is HTMLon() or cat('&lt;htmlon/>')
in R scripts. To turn HTML mode off, send '&lt;htmloff/>' or HTMLoff()
in R scripts.</p>

<h4>rpadHideSource</h4>

<p>"true" if the script source is hidden (outputs are shown). The
default is "false".</p>

<h4>Rpad Configuration Options</h4>

You can set various settings and defaults for Rpad with an rpadConfig
section in the *.Rpad file. All of the options to Rpad sections
(rpadType, rpadRun, rpadOutput, and rpadHideSource) can be set in the
rpadConfig definition. Here is an example where scripts are hidden by
default, the "alternate" gui is enabled, and the user is prompted
before browsing away from the current page:

<pre>
&lt;script type="text/javascript">
    rpadConfig = {
        gui: "alternate",
        rpadHideSource: true,
        onBeforeUnload: false
    };
&lt;/script>
&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="gui/Rpad.js">&lt;/script>
</pre>

<p>The defaults for rpadConfig are:</p>

<pre>
    gui: "none"
    rpadType: "R"
    rpadHideSource: false
    rpadOutput: "normal"
    rpadRun: "normal"
    onBeforeUnload: false
</pre>

<p>In addition to the Rpad section defaults, the option "gui" can be
used to specify the page editing gui. If set to true, the option
"onBeforeUnload" means to ask the user if it's okay to browse away
from the current page. </p>

<dl>
<dt>gui = <b>"none"</b> (the default)</dt><dd>No editing gui. Most
like a regular webpage.</dd>  
<dt>gui = <b>"standard"</b></dt><dd>An editable gui where the whole
page is editable. </dd>  
<dt>gui = <b>"alternate"</b></dt><dd>An editable gui where the user
can use the keyboard or mouse to select parts of the page for
editing. This is more crossplatform than the "standard" gui, but it is
still not completely "natural".</dd>  
<dt>onBeforeUnload = <b>false</b> (the default)</dt><dd>Normal webpage
behavior -- the user can browse away from the current page.</dd>  
<dt>onBeforeUnload = <b>true</b></dt><dd>An alert requires the user to
confirm before browsing away from the current page (including a reload
and hitting the back button).</dd>  
</dl>


<h3>HTML Form Elements</h3>

<p>HTML form elements (input, select, radio, and checkbox) with a name
tag are automatically sent to R when calculate is run. The 'name' is
translated into an R variable name. To make the GUI elements
selectable, they must be surrounded by &lt;span
contenteditable=&quot;false&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (also for url links
and buttons). </p>

<p>Input elements have two options. The default is that the input is
read as an R expression. To have the input treated as a string,
specify rpadType="Rstring" in the declaration of the input.</p>

<p>Radio buttons have two names: commonName is the the name of the
radio button set, and variableName is the specific name of this radio
button.</p>

<p>If you have several input elements together, it is best to wrap
them in a &lt;form> element. Then, all elements are passed to R
together rather than one at a time, so the page is more responsive.</p>


<h3>Javascript Options</h3>

<p>You can use javascript to add interactivity to your Rpad pages. The
easiest way is to add javascript commands to buttons. Some common
functions that can be used in an Rpad HTML file are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>rpad.calculatePage() -- calculate the page</li>
  <li>rpad.calculateNext(node) -- Calculates the first Rpad widget after or under the given DOM node</li>
</ul>


<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Here is an example of a complete Rpad HTML file:</p>

<pre>
&lt;html>
  &lt;head>
    &lt;title>GUI Examples&lt;/title>
    &lt;meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
    &lt;script type="text/javascript">
        rpadConfig = {
            gui: "alternate",
            rpadHideSource: true
        };
    &lt;/script>
    &lt;script type="text/javascript" src="gui/Rpad.js">&lt;/script>
  &lt;/head>

  &lt;body>
    &lt;span contenteditable="false">
      &lt;form>
        &lt;input type="checkbox" name="isPepperoni">Pepperoni &lt;br/>
        &lt;input name="favoriteNumber" rpadType=" Rvariable" value="44">Favorite number&lt;br/>
      &lt;/form>
    &lt;/span>
    &lt;br/>

    &lt;pre dojoType="Rpad rpadRun="init">
      HTMLon()
      data(state)
      select("favoriteAmericanState", state.name) # generate a select box
    &lt;/pre>

    &lt;pre dojoType="Rpad">
      cat("isPepperoni=",isPepperoni,"\n")
      cat("favoriteAmericanState=",favoriteAmericanState,"\n")
    &lt;/pre>
  &lt;/body>
&lt;/html>
</pre>

<p>In Rpad_input
sections, everything must be valid HTML,
so <code>"&lt;-"</code> must be <code>"&amp;lt;-"</code>. Also,
&lt;br/&gt; tags are needed for line breaks in div sections (they are
not needed in textarea or pre sections). </p>

<h3>Rpad 1.1.0 (Dojo port) incompatibilities</h3>
<p>The Dojo port (1.1.0) has introduced some
incompatibilities at the *.Rpad level relative to version
0.9.6. Basically, here's what is different:</p>

<br>
OLD:<br>
&lt;script type="text/javascript"
src="editor/rpad_loader.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;<br>
<br>
NEW:<br>
&lt;script type="text/javascript"
src="gui/Rpad.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;<br>
<br>
OLD:<br>
&lt;pre class="Rpad_input" rpad_type="R"&gt;<br>
ls()<br>
&lt;/pre&gt;<br>
<br>
NEW:<br>
&lt;pre dojoType="Rpad" rpadType="R"&gt;<br>
ls()<br>
&lt;/pre&gt;<br>
<br>
OLD:<br>
&lt;span class="wrapperForHidden" contenteditable="false"&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;pre class="Rpad_input"
rpad_type="R" style="DISPLAY: none"&gt;<br>
ls()<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/pre&gt;<br>
&lt;/span&gt;<br>
<br>
NEW:<br>
&lt;pre dojoType="Rpad" rpadType="R" rpadHideSource="true"&gt;<br>
ls()<br>
&lt;/pre&gt;<br>
<br>



      <h2>Server Setup in the Client/Server Version</h2>

      <p>The files in Rpad are layed out as follows on the server:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>/Rpad -- The main *.html pages and data go here.</li>

        <li>/Rpad/editor -- This has the old Rpad javascript GUI stuff,
        including HTMLArea.</li>

        <li>/Rpad/gui -- This has the new client-side javascript GUI stuff.</li>

        <li>/Rpad/server -- This has the Perl server-side scripts.</li>

        <li>/Rpad/server/ddXXXXXXXX -- When Rpad scripts are run,
        they're run from temporary directories under the /Rpad/server
        directory.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>In Rpad scripts, although you can access files in the main directory (the
      directory of the page) with "../../whatever", you are better off
      using <code>RpadBaseFile("whatever")</code> to maintain
      compatibility with the local version of Rpad. You can access
      files in the R process's current directory as you would
      normally, but if you want to specify it as a URL for output in
      the browser (for a link or an embedded file), use <code>RpadBaseURL("whatever")</code>.</p>

      <p>In the client/server version, each Rpad page gets its own R process on the server, so it is
      rather resource intensive. Threading and Duncan Temple Lang's
<a href="http://developer.r-project.org/TODO-DTL.html">idea</a> of "multiple interpreters" would greatly
help reduce the resource usage on the server. </p>

      <h2>Browser-Server Communications</h2>

      <p>Rpad uses Xmlhttp to communicate between the browser and the
      server, so browser refreshes are not needed to update data. This
      is available for both Mozilla and IE. Rpad uses standard HTTP
      GET or PUT requests, and all
      data is transmitted as ascii. Xmlhttp allows both synchronous
      and asynchronous communications. The best implementation (I've
      tried both) appears to be asynchronous. Synchronous
      communications can lock up the browser for long periods if the
      server becomes unavailable, or there's a communications
      glitch. Asynchronous communication avoids this, but the logic is
      more contorted internally.</p>

      <h2>Security</h2>

      <p>There is no built in security in Rpad. The user has complete
      access to any command in R and also in the system shell. I
      consider this a feature, not a bug. For protection, the system
      needs to be locked down on the server. Write protect any files
      and databases that are a concern, and lock out access to the
      server user to other parts of the system.</p>

      <p>With the base setup, Rpad users can stomp on each others
      files. If a user saves a file in the Rpad directory, another user
      can write over it. To make it more permanent, the user would have
      to request that the system administrator write protect the file
      and any data that went with the file.</p>

      <p>Because of the relatively lax security, Rpad is best
      suited for intranets or other relatively controlled
      situations.</p>

      <p>Rpad could be integrated into a more advanced content
      management system that would better handle multiple users,
      passwords, and so on.</p>

      <h2>Server Installation</h2>

      <p>For notes on server installations, click <a href="ServerNotes.html">here</a>.</p>

      <h2>Differences Between the Local Version and the Client/Server Version</h2>

      <p>In the client/server version, each Rpad page gets its own R
      process on the server. So, multiple users won't interfere with
      each other. In the local version of Rpad, the browser
      connects with one R process, so there is more chance of
      interaction between multiple Rpad pages. Each time the user
      starts a new page in the client-server version, the local
      environment is clean. But in the local version of Rpad,
      this is not true: the local environment may have objects from
      previous Rpad pages or from interaction at the command line. </p> 

      <p>There are several differences in directory layouts between
      the local and client-server versions of Rpad. In the local
      version, the current working directory of the R process is the
      directory of the Rpad page. In the client-server version, the
      current directory of the R process is two levels below the Rpad
      page (something like /var/www/Rpad/server/ddjieyfewx/ for files
      with a root of /var/www/Rpad/). In both versions, graphics are
      created in R's current working directory. But pages may read or
      write data differently depending on whether in the local or
      client-server version. See the Rpad functions RpadURL,
      RpadBaseURL, and RpadBaseFile for convenience utilities to make
      pages portable between the local version and the client-server
      verstion.</p>

      <p>In the local version of Rpad, the default graphics device is
      R's builtin png device. On the client-server version, the
      default graphics device is the ghostscript-based pngalpha
      device. Therefore, graphic files may look different between
      versions. The pngalpha device has the advantage that it is
      antialiased, you can link to an eps file, and you have more
      fonts. The disadvantages of the pngalpha device are that you
      have to have ghostscript installed, and it's slower. On the
      server side, if you want to use R's png device on unix, you
      must have X running.  </p>
